Rashika, a name like the morning breeze,  
Soft as petals, strong as trees.  
In her eyes, the twilight glows,  
With mysteries only the moonlight knows.  

She walks where silence dares not tread,  
With dreams like lanterns gently spread.  
A spark, a flame, a glowing tide,  
A universe she keeps inside.  

The stars lean close when she’s near,  
Drawn by her spirit, bold and clear.  
A whisper wrapped in thunder’s call,  
She rises, and the shadows fall.  

The ocean speaks in her quiet grace,  
Each wave a verse upon her face.  
She listens not to fear or doubt,  
Her heart too fierce to live without.  

Rashika, child of storm and sun,  
A melody just now begun.  
She writes in ink the winds can't smudge,  
A soul too wild for time to judge.  

Mountains bow where she has stood,  
Rooted deep in ancient wood.  
Yet light enough to touch the sky,  
A dreamer with unblinking eye.  

She laughs like bells in morning air,  
Joy scattered like flowers in her hair.  
Yet in her stillness lies a fire,  
A quiet, unrelenting desire.  

Not made for cages, not for chains,  
She dances in the summer rains.  
Each drop a note, each step a beat,  
The storm and sun at her feet.  

Oh Rashika, name of fire and flow,  
Wherever you go, the wild things grow.  
A story inked in stardust hue,  
Forever bright, forever true.
