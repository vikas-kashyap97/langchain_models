What are Vector stores?
Vector stores (also called vector databases) are specialized data storage systems designed to store and manage high-dimensional vector embeddings — numerical representations of data such as text, images, or audio — for fast and efficient similarity search.

These are often used in AI and ML applications, especially those involving natural language processing (NLP) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where finding similar vectors quickly and accurately is critical.


Key Features of Vector Stores-

1. Storage
- Stores high-dimensional vectors (e.g., 512, 768, or more dimensions).
- In-memory or persistent storage: Some vector stores keep data in-memory (faster, less scalable), others persist it to disk.
- On-disk storage: Some vector stores use disk storage for durability and large-scale use.

2. Similarity Search
Fast nearest neighbor (k-NN) search in high-dimensional space.

Supports various similarity metrics:
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean (L2) distance
- Inner product (dot product)

3. Indexing
- Indexes are built to accelerate search (e.g., IVF, HNSW, PQ).
- Can trade off between speed and accuracy.
- Some systems support dynamic indexing (adding/removing vectors after initial creation).

4. CRUD Operations
- Manage the lifecycle of data - adding new vectors, reading them, updating existing entries, removing outdated vectors.

Use-Cases
1. Semantic Search
2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Image/Multimedia Search
